# AWS ASSOCIATED NOTES

## Legacy

  - **AWS Import/Export Disk** accelerates moving large amounts of data into and out of the AWS cloud using portable storage devices for transport.

  - **AWS Import/Export** transfers your data directly onto and off of storage devices using Amazon's high-speed internal network and bypassing the internet.

### Snowball

- **Snowball** is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS. Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns. Transferring data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed Internet.

- 80 TB snowball in all regions. Snowball uses multiple layers of security designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant enclosures, 256-bit encryption, and an industry standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both security and full chain-of-custody of your data. Once the data transfer job has been processed and verified, AWS performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.

### Snowball Edge

- Snowball Edge is a 100 TB data transfer device with on-board storage and compute capabilities. You can use snowball edge to move large amounts of data in/out aws, as temporary storage tier for large local datasets, or to support local workloads in remote or offline locations.

- Snowball Edge connects to your existing applications and infrastructure using standard storage interfaces, streamlining the data transfer process and minimizing setup and integration. Snowball Edge can cluster together to form a local storage tier and process your data on-premises, helping ensure your applications continue to run even when they are not able to access the cloud.

- **SnowMobile** (the truck)
